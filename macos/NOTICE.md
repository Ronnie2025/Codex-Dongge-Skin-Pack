# Notices

Codex Dream Skin Studio is an **unofficial** customization project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI**.

## Software license

The MIT License in `LICENSE` applies to the **software source code** in this repository (scripts, CSS, injectors, and docs that describe the software).

It does **not** grant rights to:

- OpenAI or Codex trademarks, product names, logos, or trade dress
- Official Codex / ChatGPT application binaries, `.app` bundles, or `app.asar`
- Any user-supplied images or third-party artwork you drop into a theme
- Character likenesses, franchise art, or celebrity imagery

## Bundled artwork

The Dongge images under `assets/`, `bundled-themes/`, and the repository-level
`themes/` directory were generated with Codex imagegen from user-supplied identity
references. They are not covered by the MIT software license. Confirm the subject's
likeness and publication permission before publishing or redistributing the artwork.

`assets/portal-hero.png` is an older abstract, no-character replacement source;
it is not the selected default preset.

## Runtime

This project does not redistribute Node.js. At runtime it validates and uses the Node.js executable already signed and bundled inside the user's official Codex desktop application.

## Security model

Themes are applied through Chromium DevTools Protocol on **loopback only**. While a themed session is running, treat the local debugging port as sensitive: do not run untrusted local software that could attach to it. Use the Restore launcher to tear down the themed session and debugging port.
